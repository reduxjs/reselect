## [v4.0.0](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v4.0.0) - 2018/09/30

### New Features

Use provided memoize function for selectors (#297)

## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v3.0.0) - 2017/03/24

### New Features

Performance improvements (thanks to @johnhaley81)  
Updated Typescript typings (thanks to everyone who helped)

### Breaking Changes

For performance reasons, a selector is now not recalculated if its input is equal by reference (`===`).

#### Example:

```js
import { createSelector } from 'reselect'

const mySelector = createSelector(
  state => state.values.filter(val => val < 5),
  values => {
    console.log('calling..')
    return values.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0)
  },
)

var createSelector = require('./dist/reselect.js').createSelector

const mySelector = createSelector(
  state => state.values.filter(val => val < 5),
  values => {
    console.log('calling..')
    return values.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0)
  },
)

var state1 = { values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] }
console.log(mySelector(state1))
state1.values = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
console.log(mySelector(state1))
var state2 = { values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] }
console.log(mySelector(state2))
var state3 = { values: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] }
console.log(mySelector(state3))
```

#### Output in v2.5.4:

```
calling..
10
calling..
7
calling..
10
calling..
7
```

#### Output in v3.0.0:

```
calling..
10
10
calling..
10
calling..
7
```

When a selector uses defaultMemoize, if an exception is thrown for a set of arguments then the selector should also throw when called again with those arguments. (#144)

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2015/10/02

### Breaking Changes

#### `createSelector`, `createStructuredSelector`, and custom selector creators check arguments

Input selectors are now verified to be functions during selector creation. If verification fails an error is thrown, allowing for a useful stack trace

There is a small chance that this could cause a breaking change in code that contains a faulty selector that is never called.

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 2015/09/16

### New features

#### `createStructuredSelector`

`createStructuredSelector` is a convenience function that helps with a common pattern when using Reselect. The selector passed to a connect decorator often just takes other selectors and maps them to keys in an object:

```js
const mySelectorA = state => state.a
const mySelectorB = state => state.b

const structuredSelector = createSelector(
  mySelectorA,
  mySelectorB,
  mySelectorC,
  (a, b, c) => ({
    a,
    b,
    c,
  }),
)
```

`createStructuredSelector` takes an object whose properties are input-selectors and returns a structured selector. The structured selector returns an object with the same keys as the `inputSelectors` argument, but with the selectors replaced with their values.

```js
const mySelectorA = state => state.a
const mySelectorB = state => state.b

const structuredSelector = createStructuredSelector({
  x: mySelectorA,
  y: mySelectorB,
})

const result = structuredSelector({ a: 1, b: 2 }) // will produce {x: 1, y: 2}
```

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2015/09/09

### Breaking Changes

If upgrading from 0.0.2, see the release notes for v1.0.0-alpha

## [v1.0.0-alpha2](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha2) - 2015/09/01

### New features

src directory included in npm package
js:next field added to package.json

## [v1.0.0-alpha](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha) - 2015/09/01

### Breaking Changes

`createSelectorCreator` takes a user specified memoize function instead of a custom `valueEqualsFunc`.

#### Before

```js
import { isEqual } from 'lodash'
import { createSelectorCreator } from 'reselect'

const deepEqualsSelectorCreator = createSelectorCreator(isEqual)
```

#### After

```js
import { isEqual } from 'lodash'
import { createSelectorCreator, defaultMemoize } from 'reselect'

const deepEqualsSelectorCreator = createSelectorCreator(defaultMemoize, isEqual)
```

### New features

#### Variadic Dependencies

Selector creators can receive a variadic number of dependencies as well as an array of dependencies.

#### Before

```js
const selector = createSelector(
  [state => state.a, state => state.b],
  (a, b) => a * b,
)
```

#### After

```js
const selector = createSelector(
  state => state.a,
  state => state.b,
  (a, b) => a * b,
)
```

#### Access `ownProps` in Selector

Selector dependencies can receive a variadic number of parameters allowing a selector to receive `ownProps` passed from `mapToProps` in `connect`.

```js
const selector = createSelector(
  state => state.a,
  (state, props) => state.b * props.c,
  (_, props) => props.d,
  (a, bc, d) => a + bc + d,
)
```

#### Configurable Memoize Function

```js
import { createSelectorCreator } from 'reselect'
import memoize from 'lodash.memoize'

let called = 0
const customSelectorCreator = createSelectorCreator(memoize, JSON.stringify)
const selector = customSelectorCreator(
  state => state.a,
  state => state.b,
  (a, b) => {
    called++
    return a + b
  },
)
assert.equal(selector({ a: 1, b: 2 }), 3)
assert.equal(selector({ a: 1, b: 2 }), 3)
assert.equal(called, 1)
assert.equal(selector({ a: 2, b: 3 }), 5)
assert.equal(called, 2)
```
