# CREDITS

* Based on a proposal for Redux by Robert Binna
  (https://github.com/speedskater) and Philip Spitzlinger. Lots of the
  basic structure of the code is thanks to this.

* Refactored into reselect library by Martijn Faassen and Lee Bannard
  at the React Europe Hackathon 2015. Also added tests.

* Contributors: Lee Bannard, Martijn Faassen, Robert Binna, Alex
  Guerra, ryanatkn, Adam Royle, Christian Schuhmann, Jason Huang,
  Daniel Barreto, Mihail Diordiev, Daniela Borges, Philip Spitzlinger,
  C. T. Lin, SpainTrain

* Inspired by getters in Nuclear.js and subscriptions in re-frame.
