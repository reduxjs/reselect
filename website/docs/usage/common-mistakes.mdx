# Common Mistakes

A somewhat common mistake is to write an <InternalLinks.InputSelectors text="input selector" /> that extracts a value or does some derivation, and a <InternalLinks.ResultFunction /> that just returns its result:

```ts
// ❌ BROKEN: this will not memoize correctly, and does nothing useful!
const brokenSelector = createSelector(
  [(state: RootState) => state.todos],
  todos => todos,
)
```

Any <InternalLinks.ResultFunction /> that just returns its inputs is incorrect! The <InternalLinks.ResultFunction /> should always have the transformation logic.

Similarly:

```ts
// ❌ BROKEN: this will not memoize correctly!
const brokenSelector = createSelector(
  [(state: RootState) => state],
  state => state.todos,
)
```
