## <ExternalLinks.ReReselect>Re-reselect</ExternalLinks.ReReselect>

Enhances Reselect selectors by wrapping <InternalLinks.CreateSelector /> and returning a memoized collection of selectors indexed with the cache key returned by a custom resolver function.

Useful to reduce selectors recalculation when the same selector is repeatedly called with one/few different arguments.

- Measure selector recomputations across the app and identify performance bottlenecks
- Check selector dependencies, inputs, outputs, and recomputations at any time with the chrome extension
- Statically export a JSON representation of your selector graph for further analysis

<Link to="https://github.com/vlanemcev/reselect-debugger-flipper">the connect app</Link> for debugging selectors in **React Native Apps**.

Inspired by Reselect Tools, so it also has all functionality from this library and more, but only for React Native and Flipper.

- Selectors Recomputations count in live time across the App for identify performance bottlenecks
- Highlight most recomputed selectors
- Dependency Graph
- Search by Selectors Graph
- Selectors Inputs
- Selectors Output (In case if selector not dependent from external arguments)
- Shows "Not Memoized (NM)" selectors
